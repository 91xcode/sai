		How to use
		Each file is a serverless process
		API files stored in the /api folder
		Routing maps to file names, e.g. /api/route2.php will map to the route /api/route2
		You can override routing in vercel.json (this is now a legacy prop)
		Run vercel on command-line to push your project up on a preview URL. You can also connect Vercel to a GitHub repository and have it auto-deploy on code commits.
